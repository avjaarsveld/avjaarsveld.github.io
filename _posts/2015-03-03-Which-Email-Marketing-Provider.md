*Icontact advertise a plan for 10000 subscribers at £48.84 on their website,
however a plan with all the features mentioned in the table would cost in
the region of $250 per month.

**Mandrill charges per email, whereas the other providers charge per subscriber with
unlimited emails to each subscriber. This is free for the first 12k emails,
then $0.20 per 1000 emails for the next million emails, etc. So to send 100,000 emails in a
month, you'd pay $17.60. See [here](https://mandrill.com/pricing/) for details.
