Because ruby methods are named well in general, with easy to remember or guess names this sheet should stay relatively empty. These are some memory joggers...

## What are you?

```
a.is_a? String
a.kind_of? Integer
a.instance_of? Float
```

## Cool Stuff

This section is not for "memory joggers" but rather just some things that make Ruby super cool. Enjoy

```
a,b = ["1", "2"]

> a
=> "1"

> b
=> "2"
```

... more to come ...
