Creating manual model diagrams (Entity-Relationship Diagrams) for rails applications
is a laborious task, especially for more complex or bigger applications. There are
fortunately some tools to generate these for you automatically.

These include [rails-erd](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd) and
[railroady](https://github.com/preston/railroady).

Rails-ERD is easy to use. Simply install Graphviz, add the gem and run the `rake erd`
take task, as explained [here](http://voormedia.github.io/rails-erd/install.html).

> This post is not finished, more details will be added (about railroady and/or similar
> tools), and this is expected to be done by 2025 at the latest.
