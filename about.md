There's lots of information about me *out there*, you just need to know where to look...

## Work Experience and Qualifications
* [My LinkedIn profile](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/albertvj) has up to date (ish) details of where
I've worked, etc.
* [My Monster profile](http://beknown.com/albert-vanjaarsveld) has the kind of details you'd
normally find on a CV. I don't update this very often.

## Dev Community
* I spend a lot of time on [Github](https://github.com/avjaarsveld). Unfortunately my employer's
repositories are all private, so
[you won't see much of what I'm up to]({% post_url 2015-01-23-My-Github-Profile-looks-empty %}).
* I have asked extremely few questions on
[Stack Overflow and related sites](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1887925/avjaarsveld) (as you can
almost always find the answer you're looking for by searching instead).
* This blog (will when it's done) contain my dev  notes and thoughts.

## Social
* [My Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/asvj3) is where you can connect with me if we're
friends or family.

## More!
